## Inspiration

Unemployment has been a pressing issue not just in Jamaica but across the world. Our team was inspired to build this chatbot because we believe this could reduce the unemployment rate around the world by helping individuls to improve their employability in the job market.

## What it does

This Chatbot has been designed with the aim to assist/coach interested individuals on how to conduct themselves in an interview setting, give them valuable tips with a resume ane helps with job suggestions. All the job needs in one comprehensive chatbot. It leads the user through a series of questions which are typically asked in a interview and suggest possible answers to those questions along with providing the user with any necessary correction if they do not answer correctly. This chatbot also gives resume tips and ideas to help the user to feel more comfortable going into their job interview.

## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases

1. 1 Interview Coaching
1. 2 Resume Help
1. 3 Job Suggestions

## How we built it

Tech Stack & Documentation:

- 1
- 2

## Challenges we ran into

1. Challenge 1
  We wanted to include the Google Cloud Talent Solution API for the job suggestions use case. We didn't get a chance to see if it could work because we were still new to the chatbot and only had a few days. The race against time was exhilirating though
1. Challenge 2

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Accomplishment 1
  We got to to include as much as 3 core features. We're proud to have accomplished that much in such a short time
- Accomplishment 2
  We got a chance to include an algirithm that suggest the best type of job for a user based on the questions asked. This algorithm uses the concept of a hits on a grid based on responses received by each user. In the time it was created, it was designed to have as much as 27 different possible permutations.  

## What we learned

- Learning 1
  We understood the concept of programming better. We used a language that none of us had built a software of this caliber with before. Being out of our comfort zone, we realised that if we can truly appreciate the programming concept, then all these different programming languages will just be syntaxes.
- Learning 2
  We learnt from each other. Everyone had amazing ideas that none of us thought of. We certainly learned that working in a team can accomplish wonderful things. It was the only reason why we could not only finish on time, but deliver a quality product doing justice to the idea.
 - Learning 3
  How to build chatbots. Not only that, but we discovered the powere of messenger. The potential, the reach, it can be incorporated in anything. 

## What's next for “Kingsley”

Product Roadmap - next features for example

1. Feature 1
  Kingsley will be incorporating the Google Cloud Talent Solutions API. This will better allow Kingsley to suggest jobs to users. Who knows maybe Kingsley will be able to apply for them... 
  
1. Feature 2
  We intend to attempt at integrating Grammerbot.io or another API to have Kingsley scan resumes to point out errors. With this Kingsley can improve in with corrections and being more helpful. As it's aligned with his core functions, being able to help users the best way possible is the goal in his creation.
